<p>It's been a while since we posted anything on this little piece of Internet land we call home. That’s because we’ve been totally occupied and running full tilt towards something very exciting.</p>
<h1>What has been keeping us so busy?<br />
<!--more--></h1>
<p>After we launched our alpha/proof-of-concept in May 2011 we spent a lot of time analyzing data about how it was being used and such. Taking that knowledge we went back to our geek lab and built an entirely new approach for our product. This second iteration, for which we just opened a public beta, is so different we even changed the name. It’s called <a href="http://www.twitter.com/everythingme">EverythingMe.</a> You can read about it more <a href="http://holtz.com/blog/blog/mobile-search-the-paradigm-is-shifting-beneath-our-feet/3839/">here</a> and <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2012/03/13/the-best-new-app-at-sxsw-everything-me-redefines-mobile-search">here</a>. This release is the result of months of focused work, and now that we have opened the doors publicly, we wanted to share some of the technological aspects of this release with you:<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<h1>We're in your browser baby</h1>
<p>No mess. No fuss. Just pop your smartphone (iPhone or Android) browser over to <a href="http://everything.me/">http://everything.me</a> and let the magic happen. You now can access our product via a HTML5 web application that’s built on the same stack the publishers on our platform use. The answer to your next question is yes. We also will be releasing native apps for iPhone, Android and Windows phone 7.5.</p>
<h1>We're faster than a speeding bullet</h1>
<p>If you haven’t checked out EverythingMe for yourself yet (and if not what are you waiting for?), here’s what you’re missing.  We provide results <span style="text-decoration: underline;">instantly</span>. When we get a new query, we analyze it, figure out the user's intent, pick the right Instant Apps, and package it all into our smooth UI including icons and what not in under 50ms. We also do it as you type.</p>
<h1>We're a lot smarter</h1>
<p>In our proof-of-concept version, aka DoAT, users had to pick their choices from a list of options or “@ experiences”. As a refresher, if you typed in “Madonna” you then had to pick from @music, @movies, etc). With EverythingMe  we’ve released a smarter semantic and statistic engine capable of making a lot of these decisions for you, providing you with the results you want without you having to choose anything. You can still refine the results in case you'd like to.</p>
<h1>And there's tons of cool engineering and algorithms under the hood</h1>
<p>We promise to share more of what's under the hood in the near future. We’ll tell more about the tools we use, the way we handle code, releases and monitoring.</p>
<p>A final note – EverythingMe is a big project. That’s why we’re now referring to ourselves as <a href="http://corp.everything.me">The Everything Project</a> as we evolve this new solution. This is truly an ongoing endeavor to help smartphone users find everything about anything and do that through the best user experience they can with little effort on their part. This is a true <strong>beta</strong> product where there's much to be done to improve, and where feedback is crucial so feel free to give us a shout if you feel like it.</p>
