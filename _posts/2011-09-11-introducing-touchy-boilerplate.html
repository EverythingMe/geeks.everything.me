<p>In the past year and change we've built and deployed well above 50 mobile web apps. We've also been helping publishers creating their own mobile presence on DoAT.</p>
<p>Today we're releasing something pretty damn cool - our internal starter kit for creating kick-ass mobile web apps - Touchy&trade; Boilerplate (aka Touchy&trade;BP).</p>
<p>We'll be showing it off in SF this weekend at the TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon and for the folks who are here our CTO Joey Simhon will be leading a workshop on Saturday afternoon to dig into Touchy&trade;BP and help people kick start kick ass web apps.</p>
<p>So go ahead and download Touchy&trade;BP, it'll get you to a responsive kick-ass web app faster and easier.<br />
