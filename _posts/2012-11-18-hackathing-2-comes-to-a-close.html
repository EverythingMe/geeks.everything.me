<p>Last weekend we opened our doors to developers from all over in our second <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2012/11/12/hackathing-2-is-almost-here/">HackAthing</a>. Everything worked out as planned... if you don't count the 3 times we had to flee over to the shelter.</p>
<p>Every participant got a t-shirt, a 1/2 liter beer glass and a clear path to the keg. Already worth it!<br />

We started it off with a brief welcome, then a great intro on Game Design principles, followed by an Advanced Mobile Web APIs walk trough with a showcase of POCs to get some jaws dropped.</p>
<p>A bit of mingling, laptops setup, glasses filled and wifi connected - hack was on.<!--more--></p>

<p>End of weekend, lots of projects have emerged. Here's a recap of <strong>some</strong> of them:</p>
<h1><strong>Colorball shooting</strong></h1>
<p>by Omri Oren and Miki Stanger. Using your mobile device, you can flick balls of paint and watch them splatter on a remote canvas. <a href="https://github.com/omrio/ADDgames">https://github.com/omrio/ADDgames</a></p>
<h1><strong>Toy car web remote</strong></h1>
<p>by Omri Baumi and Alex Wolkov. An Arduino strapped to a car on one end, a pyhton service that controls it by wifi and listens to navigation commands sent from a mobile device using the built in accelerometer. And to top it off - a car simulator to test the remote by. Complicated but f**ing cool.</p>
<h1><strong>Web Adventure</strong></h1>
<p>by Amir Grozki and Illya Guterman. Anyone can join a multi player game world from a mobile device, controlling a figure's movement path with touch events. <a href="https://github.com/GeReV/webadventure" target="_blank">https://github.com/GeReV/webadventure</a></p>
<p>Notice anything in common to the above projects? All communicate device events (be it touch or motion) to a server via a WebSocket connection! Note to self: that's post worthy.</p>
<p>Project LockAthing from our previous event finally got it's debut. It enabled all HackAthing participants to enter Everything offices with a mere swipe on a mobile webapp. We rigged it to comply only to those nearby (using user's geolocation) and served it up with application cache to abolish impatient standing in front of the door. Behind the scenes a pub-sub system was hooked to a relay that's directly connected to the door's lock.<br />
Needless to say, everyone loved it. Those who didn't, were forced to use it.</p>

<p>So the HackAthing is over but the projects live on - on Tuesday (November 20th) every project will have the opportunity to be showcased in front of the <a href="http://www.w3c.org.il/HTML5fest/2012/" target="_blank">W3C HTML5Fest</a> audience with a 120 second on stage limit. If you happen to be there - come and say hello. Joey and I will be sporting the everything.me t-shirts obviously.</p>
