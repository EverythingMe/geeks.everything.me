<p dir="ltr">Let’s start from the bottom line, which will surprise none of you - if you’re a mobile designer, designing for Android is not something you should be intimidated by (anymore).</p>
<p>On July 31st, I gave a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/faderud/fade-rudnitsky-android-design-jul-2013-en">lecture at DigitalPlay</a>, a design conference in Israel, bringing together designers of all practices - from print, to web, to mobile and more, for a day of lectures, workshops and idea-swapping. The point of my lecture was simple - designing for Android has some challenges but many benefits. If you follow the right guidelines, you can do really awesome stuff.</p>

<p dir="ltr">I know from experience that when mobile designers think about designing an app, their go-to platform is always iOS. (Surprisingly, the second option they consider is WindowsMobile, with a whopping market share of about 3%). Very few think of Android as the first choice for a mobile app, because for them it’s uncharted territory, full of boogeymen and uncertainties.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><!--more--></p>
<p dir="ltr">Historically, we have valid reasons to shy away from Android. Until 2011 Android had no design consistency and no clear design guidelines. Add to these a huge diversity of devices, screen sizes and resolutions, and it’s clear why any designer in his or her right mind would have been wise to just drop the whole big mess and go straight into the simple, comforting hands of iOS. Another byproduct of this was that, in general, Apple’s AppStore generates more revenue for app developers, because people are more likely to pay for iOS apps than for android apps, therefore developers are less likely to invest in an android app, creating a whole chicken and egg thing going on that does not bode well for Android apps.</p>
<h1>Bleak? No way.</h1>
<p>Starting at Android 4, released at the end of 2011, Android became very design oriented. Take a look at their current brand values (“Enchant me,” “Simplify my Life,” “Make me Amazing”), and you’ll see for yourselves that they are truly committed to facilitating the easy creation of good looking apps, and a consistent design throughout the OS was just the first step. To help designers and developers, they created an almost ridiculously extensive <a href="http://developer.android.com/design/index.html">resource pool</a> with every possible tool to made app development and design super streamlined. Detailed how-to's about working with grid, colors, typographies and such, a huge library of stencils, and many more nuggets that make designers happy.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">And we ARE happy.</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Because designing for Android is fun. Unlike other operating systems, on Android you can design practically the entire usage experience top to bottom (and left to right too). From the lock screen to the launcher. (With <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.everything.launcher">Everything Home</a> we take it even one step further and change the entire screen to adapt to what the user needs, each time they look up something.)  Widgets, a feature iOS is lacking, allow me to reveal some of my apps’ content without opening the app itself. Everything I want to do on Android I can do with thru a tailored-maid app, and that gives designers the freedom to provide users with a better experience even for the most basic features such as dialing and messaging.</p>
<div>
<h1 dir="ltr">So which device / resolution should you design for?</h1>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">Google has two recommendations: start with the base resolution (mdpi) and then multiply for larger resolutions, or start with the highest resolution your app should support so it’ll be easy to decrease resources for the lower ones. Effectively, the best way to work today is with vector formats (I double dare you if you don’t!), so Google’s recommendations are less relevant. I believe that the most effective way is to continuously check your designs in real-time, so my tip is to design for your own device. There are excellent tools that provide live preview like <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android-ui-utils/" target="_blank">Android Design Preview</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spreadsong.pspreview" target="_blank">The Preview</a>, and you can find in the presentation more tools and tips that will help you navigate the variety of resolutions. Two more important things to keep in mind are: 1- don’t be tempted to copy other platforms in your UI, and 2- make sure you check your designs on multiple devices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I’ve met the other day an excellent designer that uses a Nokia E71 as his primary device. I must confess-- I think this is a crucial mistake. I believe that if you are an Android designer, you need to live the Android life on a daily basis. That’s the only way to really, deeply, understand your users and their experiences.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Final thought: the new iOS 7 had diverted so far off the good old iOS experience that it’s almost like using a different platform. Would that be a gateway for users to actually go out there and experience other operating systems and platforms? Time will tell.</p>
