<p>At DoAT our mission is to redefine how people search on mobile phones, providing an experience for our users that was born for the mobile, and an open platform for publishers and app developers on which to innovate.</p>
<p>Here at DoAT the geeks are the ones tasked with bringing this great platform to life, nurturing it ... and sometimes even babysitting. :)</p>
<p>Someone once asked me what kind of person joins our group here at DoAT. My response was: "Rare individuals who are, first and foremost, good people who are fun to be around, passionate about our profession, understand what it means to deliver great technology, and know to appreciate professionalism when they encounter it".</p>

<p>DoAT Geeks is a group of great people who happen to be passionate and gifted engineers coming from various disciplines - Web, Mobile, Backend, Search and Algorithms, Ops and what not.</p>
<p>Stick around and we'll do our best to share our knowledge, philosophy, lessons learned and lots of code.</p>
