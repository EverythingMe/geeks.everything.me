<p>##The Concept<br />
&lt;p&gt;What are we doing here ?&lt;br&gt;<br />
This<br />
##Why not Using a Widget ?<br />
&lt;p&gt;If you ever tried to create a (homescreen) Widget you are probably aware to the [RemoteViews](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/RemoteViews.html) concept. In short, these are views who can be controlled by a different process. Initially, we thought creating a 4x4 widget with a search box and a place for results to populate. This way we could add our dynamism to every other launcher, without having to create one of our own, but guess what, RemoteViews do not support EditText, as Romain Guy states, [When something missing seems obvious and easy, it probably isn't :)](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/android-framework/IJJLTCop7JY), which left us with no other cohice but creating a full blown launcher...<br />
&lt;p&gt;<br />
## Vanilla Launcher<br />
&lt;p&gt;Google have made an awesome job with it's Android launcher. ICS launcher is the best thing that happened to Android IMO (after hardware acceleration), and so we decided to use [CyanogenMod's Trebuchet](https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_packages_apps_Trebuchet/tree/jellybean) which is a slightly modified version of com.android.launcher2, it was definatily a great place to start from.<br />
&lt;p&gt;You can actually see how google implemented (most of) its best Android development practice when writing it, optimized custom views, really good usage of their Animator framework, very mininal GPU overdraw, I couldn't find even one error when I enabled StrictMode ;) , but it seems like the code could really use some breaking down for some of its components, some of the functions reach ~300 (!??) lines of code.<br />
&lt;p&gt;In my launcher research I have discovered that most of the OEM's launchers are also forked versions of com.android.launcher2. Samsung (TouchWiz), HTC (Sense), Motorola, LG, all used Launcher2 as a source for their lanucher.<br />
##Long List of Permissionsâ€¦<br />
This launcher has an extensive searching mechanism, in order to be able to give the best results possible, we added a long list of permissions to Everything Launcher, but you will find that every permission has its cause. (Add permission list and explainations (?))<br />
##Search Components (Search Providers)<br />
&lt;p&gt;We have found Android [Content Provider](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-provider-basics.html) to be an extremely potent search mechanism.<br />
&lt;p&gt;Of course we couldn't have shown all those great results without a turbo charged, ultra accurate, lean and mean backend, which realizes the user search context and makes most of the hard decisions for the client.<br />
##&lt;strike&gt;WebView lifecycle (hidden views vs. processes)&lt;/strike&gt;<br />
##&lt;strike&gt;Performance&lt;/strike&gt;<br />
###&lt;strike&gt;Custom Views&lt;/strike&gt;</p>
