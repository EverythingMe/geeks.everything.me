<p>Last Thu we finally had a chance of throwing our very first internal hackathon, dubbed hackAthing (with reference to The Everything Project, a subject to a whole other post).</p>
<p>The rules of engagement were quite simple, pitch your idea and get at least one additional person to work on it with you. We also threw in UX and Design support from fellow geeks, so you could get to a pretty decent looking interface as well.</p>
<p>The hacks:</p>
<p><strong>pathd</strong></p>
<p><strong>Device Logger</strong></p>
<p><strong>RainAlert</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tunocracy</strong></p>
<p><strong>DroidBell</strong></p>
<p>We recently moved to our new office, a 400 sq/m space in Tel-Aviv which we share with another company - CONTEXTin. The door is located quite far from any person on either companies, and since we do not share any infrastructure,.</p>
<p>Btw - we even created a T-Shirt for the event</p>
