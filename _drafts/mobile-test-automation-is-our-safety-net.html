<p>So it’s been quite some time that I, as the Web Dev lead at EverythingMe and one of the core members of the company, had started contemplating on the actual value I give and the difference I’m making in the company. Our core product is focused on Android and native apps and I wanted to be bring myself back into the main arena.</p>
<h2><strong>Taking ownership over version quality visibility</strong></h2>
<p>So, I sat down with our Android dev team leader and asked one simple question “Where are you hurting?”. The answer was swift - “version quality visibility”.<br />
Regressions and crashes that end up in production hurt the product bad. In the mobile app industry, instability and performance issues can be devastating. Unhappy users stop using products, causing retention to drop and app store reviews and ratings to plummet, eventually leading to dropped install and DAU rate which take their toll on revenue. Moving fast mandates wide visibility. Knowing about regressions the minute they’re introduced is a must. The QA team could not be expected to test all past features and permutations against the staggering device type fragmentation and endlessly accumulating builds. Only solid automated testing could take such responsibility upon itself.</p>
<p>Mobile test Automation is in it’s infancy I’m afraid. Most do not utilize it, and those that do, have trouble making it reliable and keeping it an integral part of the dev process and release workflow, and therefore reap little value from it.</p>
<p>That’s where we decided that I come in. I was tasked with rethinking our test automation strategy and implementation, so as to understand exactly what our product’s safety net should be. It requires taking a deep look at the development process from product specs, to feature development, to source management and standards, to release cycle and beta testing prior to pushing the launch button.</p>
<p>I’d like to share with you some insights about this exciting field.</p>
<h2><strong>Creating trust and cooperation</strong></h2>
<p>It’s not uncommon to witness automated test results get ignored and rendered irrelevant. Once strategy and tools are set in place, it takes constant work and attention to keep the dev team trusting and engaged. Test results must stay reliable, testing tools must delight the user, result visibility must be at it’s highest and the whole system must be incorporated into the release workflow.</p>
<h2><strong>All aspects of mobile testing</strong></h2>
<p>Many believe mistakenly that test automation equals UI testing but that is only a subset of the overall aspects being tested on a build. Additional aspects are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connectivity - test user experience against network deficiency and offline mode.</li>
<li>Resource consumption - make sure network and battery consumption stay at the very minimum</li>
<li>Performance - benchmark loading times and responsiveness alongside jank</li>
<li>Stress testing - find edge case scenarios causing unexpected results</li>
<li>Analytics - test that stats reports are sent correctly</li>
<li>Sensor inputs - simulate all device and user inputs such as device position, location and environment</li>
<li>Version upgrades - test on upgraded builds (as opposed to clean installations)</li>
<li>OS events - test against simulated notifications, incoming calls and system alerts</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How we do it</strong></h2>
<p>Getting into the field, we had so many questions and finding answers was tough. Not many speak on “how we do it” even in the most promising tech blogs. There’s quite an abundance of UI testing frameworks out there, but since no mobile app is like any other, no testing framework could abide in full to it’s unique needs. After much research and experimentation, we decided to make our own. We call it <a href="https://github.com/EverythingMe/magneto" target="_blank">Magneto</a>, allowing us to <em>Command our Droids</em>. In short, it’s for Android apps, built in Python, it’s powerful, super easy to set up and <a href="https://github.com/EverythingMe/magneto" target="_blank">open source</a>.</p>
<p>For benchmarking we use Probe, a tool we've built to plug into Magneto and expose performance abnormalities.</p>
<p>There’s so much more to be said about Mobile Automation, about making it work, about integrating it into the release workflow, about making sense of all the options - I hope to cover all these and give you the understanding you need in order to make it work for you.</p>
