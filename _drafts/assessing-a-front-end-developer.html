<p>I’ve been recruiting and assisting companies seeking top notch Front End developers close to a decade now. As with all software development fields, it’s not easy. It takes lots of patience and focus. In this post I'd like to share my way of thinking when I assess candidates for our incredible FED team.</p>
<h3>#1 - Quick look</h3>
<p>Once a candidate appears on your radar, you have to be capable of quickly thumbing up or down. Your time is valuable and good developers do not stay unnoticed very long, so there’s no time to waste. A quick look at a candidates CV/linkedin profile and github account will give you a lot.<br />
Here are the basic guidelines I’ve come to trust:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Experience</strong> - A lot of the programming challenges require JS skills but in order to focus on it, you need a good HTML/CSS foundation and proper debugging techniques. There's no magic number but it proved itself time and time again, that at least 4 years of diverse projects and working out the kinks of browsers are required in order to get there. </li>
<li><strong>Diversity vs Expertise</strong> - developers who work for years on the same product have proven many times unready for the “real world”. Let them get acquainted with current technologies, libraries, tools and lingo and meet them later on in their career. But web developers (especially freelancers) often acquire non-front-end skills in order to offer full web solutions. If it’s all over the place, it might prove problematic as it could mean a lack of expertise and motivation for the specific technologies your team focuses on.</li>
<li><strong>Passion</strong> - in web developers, it's super easy to research. Github projects, open source contributions, hackathon and meetup participation, speaking in confs and groups. I guarantee that extraordinary developers always open their laptop after hours.</li>
<li><strong>Team work vs Independence</strong> - if your day-to-day requires team work, you have to look for it in his history. Lack of work in a team may point to social or authority problems. But working independently is not necessarily negative as it develops an essential core of GTD and solution based decisions. It’s a fine line. Never said it was easy!</li>
<li><strong>Place of residence</strong> - yeah you heard me. If collaboration is a must in your team then members have to be somewhat unified in their arrival time. Moreover, if coming in or leaving is an effort, it may prove problematic in times of need. Trust me on this. <strong>I’d rather approach this one from a comm skills angle if possible - sounds like we’re only looking for people from Tel Aviv</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>#2 - Ring ring</h3>
<p>So your intrigue was tickled. Setting a meeting is still too early at this point. Call him up. Get a sense of the guy.<br />
Start out with putting in a solid 5-10 minutes about the company, the product, the outlook, the team and what you’re looking for in it.<br />
Now it’s time for him to shine as he now knows what’s expected of him and where the bar is set.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Communication and mutual connection</strong> - the conversation should have a comfortable flow to it. Yeah the other side might be stressed but you’re going to work with this guy - you have to know you speak the same language and have mutual goals. Laughs are good.</li>
<li><strong>Other interests</strong> - good developers are not just gifted coder - they’re explorers! See if he’s directs his passion towards other things. It might expose a different side you weren’t aware. Maybe it’s relevant to the company. Maybe he’s that drummer that’s missing from the company band.</li>
<li><strong>What he’s looking for</strong> - it’s a two way street. Does your team size up to his expectation? Also to his salary expectation. Although there is also a practical side to this - find out where he invests his time, understand his plans for the future. You’d be surprised what comes out. Sometimes red lights flash.</li>
</ul>
<h3>#3 - Face time</h3>
<p>Time to meet in person. Show him around. Get him excited about the place. Let him get a feel of the workspace atmosphere. It will prove very valuable.<br />
Sit comfortably and if you got a full product pitch - now’s the time. Usually, candidates see many companies so they need a little jolt to their memory.<br />
Talk with passion. It’s contagious.<br />
I’m gonna leave out talking about employment history and general questions. That’s not why you’re reading this.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Talk code</strong> - talk about your code and coding style. Talk about challenges the team faces. Talk as you would to the team. See if he follows along or gets lost in the information.</li>
<li><strong>What excites him</strong> - ask to elaborate on something that made his juices flow. Challenges he met. Let him expresses himself and see if you’re talking on the same level. This would be a good</li>
<li><strong>Test his knowledge</strong> - I’m not a fan of quizzes. I don’t like putting people on the spot. As developers we have constant access to documentation and references. So why test him ill equipped? I choose to send an at-home task. It relieves the pressure, enables going over it at your own free time, lets all the info you accumulated sink before making any decision.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not sure if I should elaborate on the rest of the process. Gotta keep some cards to myself, right?</p>
