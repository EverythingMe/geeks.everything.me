<p>We've been collecting analytics events ever since we start at 2010. We collected it from various mobile apps in various platforms - iOS, Android, Firefox OS and server-side events.</p>
<p>Fast forward 5 years, we've got a facts table scheme with 200+ columns in our Redshift data store and sub 100 events. This is too much to handle and makes our analytics system less approachable, even if you have re:dash open to the entire company.</p>
<p>[INSERT PROCESS DIAGRAM]</p>
<p>What are we trying to solve here?</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the time we spend on defining analytics events for new features.</li>
<li>Have a predictable event anatomy we can easily test and communicate.</li>
<li>Make our fact table more accessible to non-analysts.</li>
<li>Make less mistakes implementing event collection code and detect it earlier.</li>
<li>Make analytics collection intertwined rather than stitched to our process.</li>
</ul>
